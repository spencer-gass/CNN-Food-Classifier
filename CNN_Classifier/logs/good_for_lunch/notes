---------
full VGGnet
sorting images by putting any image that is associated with a business that is labeled good for lunch
in one directory and all else in another.
~100k training images

20 epochs, lr 1e-3, acc=66 (~60% acc at epoch 5)

1120_1718
20 more epochs, lr=1e-3 acc= 67

---------
Full VGGnet, only used images from busineses with few total labels
about ~40k training images

40 epochs lr=1e-3 acc=%70

1122_1920
40 more epochs lr=1e-4, acc=69 :(

-----
labels are associated with biz ids and biz ids are associated with pictures
    naieve method: if a business is associated with a label, label all of it's images with that label
    problem: images that are not an indication of the label are treated equally to images that are indicative.
        70% accurcy since there are many common attributes/patterns between both categories

    Atempt at improvment: average the predictions for a set of images from a business, this way they are classified to
    be generally similar to the good for lunch images. However the high loss / low training accuracy means that
    there aren't clear differences between the two categories. This method imporves accuracy to ~ 75%

    possible alternatives:
    1) make classifiers for other categories, evaluate them, and talk about why this method doesn't work
        would be better to just talk about this in the papper and not waist time here
    2) use the pretrained imagenet VGGnet that comes with keras and do a logistic regsession and see if that works
        categories of the image net challenge are wildly varied and most are not pertinante to restraunts

    3) Most common catagories of things in yelp pics food, drink, retaruant, people, meues
       Assume that food is the most important category for determining good for lunch
       use the type of food to determine good for lunch / dinner
        use only food image, associate a label with a food categoriy, train a MLP to associate food with good for lunch
        do food or not       -> food 101                              -> good for lunch classifier       

    4) Assume that a restaurant is either good for lunch, dinner or both
       use the naieve method but split images into good for dinner but not lunch, good for lunch but not dinner, or good for both
        
-----
split images into 3 categories [only good for lunch, only good for dinner, neither aka good for breakfast]
was at 51% after 19 epochs and increasing slowly
crashed!!!!!! like WTF!!!!!

-----
Split the images into two categories (lunch vs dinner)
